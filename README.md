(old package name)

R interface to the [Data Retriever](http://data-retriever.org).

The Data Retriever automates the tasks of finding, downloading, and cleaning up
publicly available data, and then stores them in a local database or csv
files. This lets data analysts spend less time cleaning up and managing data,
and more time analyzing it.

This package lets you access the Retriever using R, so that the Retriever's data
handling can easily be integrated into R workflows.

Installation
------------
To use the R package `rdataretriever` you first need to install the Retriever.
Installers are available for all major operating systems from the [Install page](http://www.data-retriever.org/#install)
or it can be installed from [source](https://github.com/weecology/retriever).

Add Retriever to the path
-------------------------
The R package takes advantage of the Data Retriever's command line interface
which must be enabled by adding it to the path on Mac platforms.
On a Windows platform the Retriever should be added automatically to the path.

Install R package
-----------------

To install the development version of the R package `rdataretriever`, use the `devtools` package:

```coffee
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("ropensci/rdataretriever")
```

Examples
--------
```coffee
library(rdataretriever)

# List the datasets available via the Retriever
rdataretriever::datasets()

# Install the portal into csv files in your working directory
rdataretriever::install_csv('portal')

# Download the raw portal dataset files without any processing to the
# subdirectory named data
rdataretriever::download('portal', './data/')

# Install and load a dataset as a list
portal = rdataretriever::fetch('portal')
names(portal)
head(portal$species)

```

New Spatial data Installation
-----------------------------

**Set-up and Requirements(Tools)**

**Tools**

-  psql, raster2pgsql, shp2pgsql, dgal,

The `rdataretriever` supports installation of spatial data into `Postgres DBMS`.

1. **Install Postgres**

	To install `Postgres` from scratch please ref to [Postgres installation](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/UsersWikiPostGIS21UbuntuPGSQL93Apt).
	For simplicity, use `.pgpass` file to avoid supplying the password every time.

	After installation, Make sure you have the paths to these tools added to your system's `PATHS`.

	Note: Older version of this `raster2pgsql` was a python script that you had to download and manually include in Postgres's  directory.
	Please consult an operating system expert for help on how to change or add the `PATH` variables.

	**For example, this could be a sample of paths exported on Mac:**

	```shell
	#~/.bash_profile file, Postgres PATHS and tools .
	export PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin:${PATH}"
	export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/10/bin"

	```

2. **Enable PostGIS extensions**

	If you have Postgres set up, enable `PostGIS extensions`.
	This is done by using either `Postgres CLI` or `GUI(PgAdmin)` and run
	**For psql CLI**
	```shell
	psql -d yourdatabase -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
	psql -d yourdatabase -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;"
	```
	**For GUI(PgAdmin)**
	```sql
	`CREATE EXTENSION postgis;`
	`CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology`
	```
	For more details refer to the
	[Postgis docs](https://postgis.net/docs/postgis_installation.html#install_short_version).

**Sample commands**

```R
rdataretriever::install_postgres('harvard-forest') # Vector data
rdataretriever::install_postgres('bioclim') # Raster data
# Install only the data of USGS elevation in the given extent
rdataretriever::install_postgres('usgs-elevation', list(-94.98704597353938, 39.027001800158615, -94.3599408119917, 40.69577051867074))
```


Using Dockers
-------------

To run the image interactively

`docker-compose run --service-ports rdata /bin/bash rdata`

To run tests

`docker-compose  run rdata Rscript load_and_test.R`
