(old package name)

R interface to the [Data Retriever](http://data-retriever.org).

The Data Retriever automates the tasks of finding, downloading, and cleaning up
publicly available data, and then stores them in a local database or csv
files. This lets data analysts spend less time cleaning up and managing data,
and more time analyzing it.

This package lets you access the Retriever using R, so that the Retriever's data
handling can easily be integrated into R workflows.

Installation
------------
To use the R package `rdataretriever` you first need to install the Retriever.
Installers are available for all major operating systems from the [Install page](http://www.data-retriever.org/#install)
or it can be installed from [source](https://github.com/weecology/retriever).

Add Retriever to the path
-------------------------
The R package takes advantage of the Data Retriever's command line interface
which must be enabled by adding it to the path on Mac platforms.
On a Windows platform the Retriever should be added automatically to the path.
