set_home(...)
}
\description{
On Windows RStudio produces different results for Sys.getenv('HOME') than
running R in other ways. This also influences CLIs for other programs wrapped
in R.  This function checks to see if an extra "Documents" has been appended
to the home path and sets the environmental variable correctly.
