ecoretriever: R interface to the EcoData Retriever.

\section{About}{


The EcoData Retriever automates the tasks of finding, downloading, and
cleaning up publicly available ecological data, and then stores them in a
local database or csv files. This lets ecologists spend less time cleaning
up and managing data, and more time doing science.

This package lets you access the Retriever using R, so that the Retriever's
data handling can easily be integrated into R workflows.
